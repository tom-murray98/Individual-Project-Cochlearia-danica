# Individual-Project-Cochlearia-danica
 The genomics of speciation and rapid range expansion in Cochlearia danica
 
 Current progress includes creating a concatenated pseudo-danica hybrid genome composed of C. excelsa (n = 6) and C. groenlandica (n = 7).
Using ngs_pipe (https://github.com/mattheatley/ngs_pipe) to create mapped bam files in order to assess coverage of each individual to the reference genome.
Using samtools coverage, samtools flagstat and bedtools intersect to assess coverage per chromosome of each sample against pseudo-danica hybrid.
