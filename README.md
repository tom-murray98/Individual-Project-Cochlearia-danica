# Individual-Project-Cochlearia-danica
 The genomics of speciation and rapid range expansion in Cochlearia danica
 
 Current progress includes:

**Step 1:  Subgenome coverage assessment of Cochlearia species against a synthetic C. danica genome**
 <br />
  <br />
  1.) Created a concatenated pseudo-C. danica hybrid genome composed of C. excelsa (n = 6) and C. groenlandica (n = 7).  
  2.) Constructed C. danica genome was mapped against multiple individuals of different Cochlearia populations using NGS pipe.  
  3.) The alignment outputs of these mappings were assessed for coverage using bedtools intersect*, samtools coverage and flagstat (Using scripts samtools_coverage.sh and samtools_flagstat.sh)
