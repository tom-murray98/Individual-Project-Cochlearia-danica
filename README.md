# Individual-Project-Cochlearia-danica
 The genomics of speciation and rapid range expansion in Cochlearia danica
 
 Current progress includes creating a concatenated pseudo-danica hybrid genome composed of C. excelsa (n = 6) and C. groenlandica (n = 7).
Using ngs_pipe (https://github.com/mattheatley/ngs_pipe) to create mapped bam files in order to assess coverage of each individual to the reference genome.
Using deeptools bamCoverage to generate bigWig files (https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/bamCoverage.html) and samtools coverage to analyse coverage (http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-coverage.html).
